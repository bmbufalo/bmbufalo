<blockquote><h1><strong>Instagrammers in Western Siberia Document Meteor Landing</strong></h1>

Moments after fragments of a meteor entered the earth’s atmosphere over eastern Siberia early Friday, Instagrammers from the Russian city of <a href="http://www.gramfeed.com/instagram/tags#Chelyabinsk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelyabinsk</a> began posting photos of the meteor’s glowing trail.

The meteor, which lit up the sky about 950 miles east of Moscow, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/world/europe/meteorite-fragments-are-said-to-rain-down-on-siberia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent a shockwave</a> through the area that shattered windows and injured many people. After the impact, Chelyabinsk resident Сергей Устюжанин (@<a href="http://instagram.com/ustyuzhanin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ustyuzhanin</a>) set out to determine exactly what had happened. Through Instagram, he shared with his friends and the world real-time photos of scenes he encountered in and around the city. “A lot of people in our city didn’t know what happened at the beginning,” he says, “so I used Instagram as a way to share what I saw.”
