From <a href="http://barkforapark.org/">Bark for a Park</a> Headquarters:

<blockquote>You and your dog are invited to the official grand opening and ribbon-cutting ceremony with Mayor Langford for the Greensprings Dog Park at George Ward Park in Birmingham! (Boy, we&rsquo;ve all waited a long time to hear those words!)   Be prepared!<br />Creative Dog Training has posted podcasts on &ldquo;Preparing Your Dog for the Dog Park&rdquo; and &ldquo;Taking Your Dog to the Dog Park.&rdquo; We encourage you to take a listen. You&rsquo;ll also want to read the dog park rules. (They&rsquo;ll also be posted at the park entrance.)   Please note that the ground is quite saturated. You will need to bring towels to dry your dog and something to protect your car seats before you let Fido back into your car after play. Be prepared for mud!   Bring poop bags! Enough for yourself and to share. This all happened so fast the waste stations and bags we ordered haven&rsquo;t yet arrived. Be responsible and clean up after your dog!   Don&rsquo;t come empty handed! We have lots of fundraising to do to pay for the fencing. We&rsquo;ll be there with Bark t-shirts, coozies, cold sodas, bottled water and more to sell. If you&rsquo;re not yet a Bark member or donor, now is the&nbsp;time!</blockquote>
