<pre><code>I have just tried to setup Intense Debate, a replacement for Blogger's commenting system.  Hope it works well.  Disqus, you tried but I haven't seen any response on when you will find a fix.  Hopefully soon.  Until then...it's Intense Debate.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;p /&gt;Intense Debate worked wonderfully!  It integrated with my blog perfectly!  The only thing it took me a second to realize is that the commenting system only shows up in individual posts not on the front page.  Maybe Disqus did work after all?  It doesn't matter because Intense Debate allows for you to sign up using OpenID and that was the winning ticket!  Excellent software!&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-855560730051228904?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
