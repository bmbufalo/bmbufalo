<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/333/alabama-crimson-tide">Alabama</a> will be without junior running back <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=379061">Mark Ingram</a> for Saturday's opener against visiting <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/23/san-jose-state-spartans">San Jose State</a>, and probably longer, after the Heisman Trophy winner underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Tuesday morning.

Ingram suffered the injury late in Monday's practice, and Alabama coach Nick Saban said it was a "situation where everyone thought it would be better to take care of now, so he would not have any issues with it later in the season."

Although Alabama officials are ruling Ingram out only for the first game at this point, it's unlikely he would be able to get back in time for the Crimson Tide's second game, against No. 19 <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/team/_/id/213/penn-state-nittany-lions">Penn State</a> on Sept. 11 in Tuscaloosa.
Saban said Ingram would be managed on a week-to-week basis after Saturday.

"We will make every decision on the future based on what's best for Mark and his career as we consult with Dr. [Lyle] Cain and Dr. [James] Andrews on his progress," Saban said. "This is not an injury that will affect Mark's future ability to make a full recovery in a relatively short time."

Sophomore <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=480206">Trent Richardson</a> will move into a starting role after rushing for 751 yards last season as Ingram's backup.

The Crimson Tide also have redshirt freshman <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/player/profile?playerId=480263">Eddie Lacy</a>.

Ingram, who became Alabama's first Heisman Trophy winner last season, rushed for 1,658 yards and scored 20 touchdowns.
