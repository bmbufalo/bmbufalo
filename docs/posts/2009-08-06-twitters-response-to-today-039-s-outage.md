      <i>As noted earlier on our <a href="http://status.twitter.com/">Status Blog</a>,
Twitter is back in action. The continuing denial of service attack is
being mitigated although there is still degraded service for some folks
while we recover completely.<p />Over the last few hours, Twitter
has been working closely with other companies and services affected by
what appears to be a single, massively coordinated attack. As to the
motivation behind this event, we prefer not to speculate.<p />Please
note that no user data was compromised in this attack. This activity is
about saturating a service with so many requests that it cannot respond
to legitimate requests thereby denying service to intended customers or
users.<p />We've worked hard to achieve technical stability and
we're proud of our Engineering and Operations teams. Nevertheless,
today's massive, globally distributed attack was a reminder that
there's still lots of work ahead.</i>
