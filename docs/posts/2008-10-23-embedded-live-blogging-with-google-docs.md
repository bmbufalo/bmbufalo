<pre><code>One day when I can travel around as a great and well known blogger who is rich and famous I will have a use &lt;a href="http://googledocs.blogspot.com/2008/07/live-blogging-with-docs.html"&gt;for this feature&lt;/a&gt; of Google Docs and Blogger.  For now I'm a poor college student with no life but here is a link to those wonderful directions on how to really be a Google Docs power user.  I did see this as a way to create and automatically updating resume on my blog and have added a link to it &lt;a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dp7dhq7_356w63c8v9r"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Now when I update my resume on Google Docs, those changes are immediately available for the world to see.  Not that it is impressive by any means (don't laugh) but I recently had an interviewer check out my blog and he mentioned there was no resume available there.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.mofuse.mobi/"&gt;bmbufalo mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-4917312480966426953?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
