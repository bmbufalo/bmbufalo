<h1>JABBERWOCKY</h1>

<h2>Lewis Carroll</h2>

(from <cite>Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There</cite>, 1872)   <span style="font-size:85%;"> `Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br /> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br />All mimsy were the borogoves,<br /> And the mome raths outgrabe.</span>

</span><span style="font-size:85%;"><br />"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!<br /> The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br />Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br /> The frumious Bandersnatch!"<br /></span>

<span style="font-size:85%;">He took his vorpal sword in hand:<br /> Long time the manxome foe he sought --<br />So rested he by the Tumtum tree,<br /> And stood awhile in thought.<br /></span>

<span style="font-size:85%;">And, as in uffish thought he stood,<br /> The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,<br />Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,<br /> And burbled as it came!<br /></span>

<span style="font-size:85%;">One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br /> The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br />He left it dead, and with its head<br /> He went galumphing back.<br /></span>

  <span style="font-size:85%;">"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?<br /> Come to my arms, my beamish boy!<br />O frabjous day!  Callooh!  Callay!'<br /> He chortled in his joy.<p /></span>

<span style="font-size:85%;"><br />`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves<br /> Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;<br />All mimsy were the borogoves,<br /> And the mome raths outgrabe.  </span>
