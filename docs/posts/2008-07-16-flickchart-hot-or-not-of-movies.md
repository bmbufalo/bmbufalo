<pre><code>I haven't had the opportunity to use it but this looks like a very interesting concept.  Flickchart lets you very simply rate your favorite and not-so-favorite movies by letting you choose between which two movies is the best.  It then develops a list of your top favorite movies and lets you discuss your favorites with friends.&lt;p /&gt;Now if they would give me an invite to the beta I could give them a better glowing review...hint...hint...&lt;p /&gt;Flickchart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.flickchart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;http://www.flickchart.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;Coffee &amp;amp; Celluloid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://coffeeandcelluloid.com/2008/07/14/flickchart-finding-the-best-movies/#" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;http://coffeeandcelluloid.com/2008/07/14/flickchart-finding-the-best-movies/#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-6010467161183888654?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
