RiffTrax Presents Manos: Hands of Fate

Message me if you are interested. It&#8217;s Thursday night at 7 at the Rave.

Description from the site: <br />
The stars of Mystery Science Theater 3000 are coming back to select movie theaters nationwide for only one night to take on one of the worst films of all time: &#8220;Manos&#8221; The Hands of Fate. Join Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett of RiffTrax.com on Thursday, August 16th for hilarious all-new riffing on a not-so-classic movie!  This one night event will be your only chance to see the guys fire their wisecracking commentary at &#8220;Manos&#8221; The Hands of Fate on the big screen.
