<pre><code>This will be a very busy week online and out and about for myself and many others.&lt;p /&gt;Today Microsoft has released Service Pack 3, the supposed last update for Windows XP.  I had a direct link this morning but it looks like it was pulled down.  Hunt it down on Microsoft's website at &amp;lt;a href=&amp;quot;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads.&lt;br /&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/downloads.&lt;br&lt;/a&gt; /&amp;gt;[Ed Note: &lt;a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13860_3-9931343-56.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Microsoft has pulled SP3&lt;/a&gt; as they cannot pull their collective head out of their ass. Click the link for the update.]&lt;p /&gt;The freebie of the week is (and for one week starting today) is to visit &lt;a href="http://www.coldplay.com"&gt;http://www.coldplay.com&lt;/a&gt; and download their latest MP3 Violet Hill.  It only costs you your email address and zip code.  Pretty light tariff.&lt;p /&gt;Friday is the opening of the &lt;a href="http://www.schaeffercrawfishboil.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Crawfish Boil&lt;/a&gt; here in Birmingham.  If you don't know, it's a huge music festivle where the main course is crawfish.  And it all goes to a good cause.&lt;p /&gt;As long as everyone's favorite Bush comes through and I get my rebate check, I should be attending with the wife.  Rebate checks will be starting to be deposited in accounts starting Friday.  It all depends on your last two of your social so &lt;a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/04/28/news/economy/rebate_update_monday/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; for more information and a calendar of payment dates.&lt;p /&gt;And finally, &lt;a href="http://ironmanmovie.marvel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Iron Man&lt;/a&gt;, the feature film, hits theaters this Friday, but will anyone go see it?  With Grand Theft Auto IV hitting shelfs today, will everyone be in a video game induced comma?  Read all about it &lt;a href="http://www.slashfilm.com/2008/04/28/will-grand-theft-auto-4-hurt-iron-mans-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and see when the &lt;a href="http://hoovermoviecrew.braincase.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Hoover Movie Crew&lt;/a&gt; plans on going to see the show!&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;p /&gt;&amp;lt;script src="http://digg.com/tools/diggthis.js" type="text/javascript"&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-5021349176127700576?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
