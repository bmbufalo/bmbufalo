<pre><code>&lt;span style="font-size:medium;"&gt;If you have an iPhone and it is running very slow after updating to iOS 4 and you are using Active Sync (Microsoft Exchange or Google Sync) then click on &lt;a href="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/TS3398/DefaultEASTaskTimeout.mobileconfig"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from Mobile Safari (on your iPhone) and install the fix Apple released. &amp;nbsp;Be sure to restart your iPhone after you apply the update. &amp;nbsp;I'm so mad it took this long for me to find this but I'll save you the sob story. &amp;nbsp;If you want the details hit up the source below.&lt;/span&gt;

<span style="font-size:medium;">My phone was almost unusable until I applied this. &nbsp;I couldn't even make a phone call. &nbsp;At one point I deleted my Gmail account and had to go without contacts. &nbsp;Boy was that fun. &nbsp;Remember when you used to have to memorize phone numbers? &nbsp;Anyways, mail and contacts started syncing immediately after I applied the fix but my calendar is not syncing but if I get a fix I'll post it up. &nbsp;Anyone else having problems with iOS 4 and Active Sync? Post a comment.</span><br />
