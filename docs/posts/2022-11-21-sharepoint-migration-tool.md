<h2>Moving to the Cloud</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of all the things corporations and businesses seem to be the most recalcitrant to migrate to the cloud, file servers seem to be near the top of the list. Often the data consists of a combination of documents that do have value but are not regularly accessed and recent documents that need to be collaborated on in the moment by teams across the organization. The last type of data, and the one that does not make sense to move to the Cloud are files that are exorbitantly large but require regular use with local systems. There are plenty of other scenarios that further carve out your data usage but for user facing needs, moving to the cloud should be an effortless process for documents they are working on or accessing. For users of Microsoft's suit of products, SharePoint Online offers a solid and reliable solution that provides everything an office worker needs.</p>
