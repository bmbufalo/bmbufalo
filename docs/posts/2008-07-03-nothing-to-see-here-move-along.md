<pre><code>I have imported all the blog entries from Hoover Movie Crew's Blog.  It is looking like the move over will be much less painful than I thought.  I don't know if this is in the regular Blogger but in Blogger in Draft you can export and import blog posts in the settings.  Excellent feature!  Makes life simple.&lt;p /&gt;There should be more improvements as the next few day's pass.  I'll get this thing straight eventually.&lt;p /&gt;I love tinkering.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I am sorry about the double entries in the RSS feeds.&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-1613756654714306577?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
