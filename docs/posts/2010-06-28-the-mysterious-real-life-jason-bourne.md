It all started with a smell of chemical fumes coming out of a luxury apartment in Los Angeles. When the police showed up, they found machine guns, counterfeiting equipment and $15,000 in high quality counterfeit Benjamins. The suspect bolted out the window, jumping across a series of balconies.

The hunt for a fugitive likened to Jason-Bourne ended up six months later with an equally mysterious question of "Who is Brian Alexik?"
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<em>The door was barricaded. A cache of loaded weapons, including an AK-47, sat next to a mosaic depicting the CIA seal. They found equipment for counterfeiting money. High-powered binoculars were trained on the U.S. Federal Reserve building next door.</em>

<em>What followed was a six-week hunt for a suspect who had slipped out of the fire escape moments earlier and whose evasiveness drew comparisons to fictional agent Jason Bourne.</em>

<em>Police would eventually find their man, Brian Alexik, hiding out in his girlfriend&rsquo;s apartment less than a mile from where he fled. But three weeks on, detectives are still trying to figure out just who he is, what plot they may have thwarted and whether he was a lone wolf or part of a larger group.</em>

It didn&rsquo;t end, however, like in the movies:
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote">
<em>"He got caught," Detective Dan Logan said. "When I interviewed him, he didn&rsquo;t knock me out, take my gun and take my recorder like in the movies. He&rsquo;s not as smart or resourceful as the Jason Bourne character."</em>
