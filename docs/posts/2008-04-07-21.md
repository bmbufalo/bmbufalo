<pre><code>We hadn't had a bite to eat so we stopped at Wendy's.  Who knew you couldn't eat a double cheese burger combo in 15 minutes?  So we were a little late to the theater and missed Superhero movie.  But the movie we did see was excellent!  21 was fun!  Great action and such a fun story.  I reminded me of Girl Next Door without the porn stars and it's set in Vegas.  And Kevin Spacey was a blast.  His performance was excellent as an asshole.  What a versatile actor.  &lt;p /&gt;Stay tuned for whats coming up for April 19th and don't forget to do your taxes!&lt;p /&gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
