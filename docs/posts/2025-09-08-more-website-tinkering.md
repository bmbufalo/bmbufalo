# More Website Tinkering

I continue to tinker here to see how far a static wesite can go. One thing I've wanted is some form of commenting but without too much overhead -- and better if it can be outsourced entirely. So I hit on an idea of just directing folks to Mastodon to post. And I implimented the automated posting of new entries as well so that as I blog, each post is represented there as well.

With any luck, this post should create a Mastadon post and appear on the blog with a link to comment.
