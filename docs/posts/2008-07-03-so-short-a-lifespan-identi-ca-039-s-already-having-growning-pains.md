<pre><code>That title sound's negative but the open source Twitter is already seeing the famed Fail Whales.&amp;nbsp; Identi.ca was all the rage on yesterdays tech blogs claiming to be the Twitter killer.&amp;nbsp; Today brings about timeouts and error messges.In there defense according the there &lt;a href="http://friendfeed.com/rooms/identica" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;feed&lt;/a&gt; on FriendFeed:&lt;div class="comment" style="margin-left:40px;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<span>I mean goodness, folks. it's open source version 0.4.1   <span style="font-weight:bold;color:rgb(34,34,34);">identi.ca</span> and @evan have both been up for nearly 24 hours with something like 3x the number of users expected in the first week. They're doing what looks like a planned or at least anticipated server change. The transparency is amazing. I think the IM stayed up through the change, but there have been DNS propagation issues. Login cookies might not work for a while. - </span><a href="http://friendfeed.com/exador23" class="friend l_popup">exador23</a>

<div class="comment">When you visit the site at http://www.identi.ca it redirects you to http://hewitt.controlezvous.ca.&nbsp; Registering accounts fail (sometimes and attempting to use OpenID errors out.&nbsp; So the growing pains begin.&nbsp; I really hope this service pans out and fixes what we all dislike about Twitter.&nbsp; I knew I should have signed up for an account yesterday!</div>
