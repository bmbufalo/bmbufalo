<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;I have stumbled upon a wonderful thing.  Someone has organized an event that pulls hundreds of different beers under one roof and allows me to partake in the festivities!  I think I found my weekend destination.  Now I just need to convince the wife to come...&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.magiccitybrewfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Magic City Brewfest 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any luck I will actually remember the camera this time and get some decent photos of this event.  Otherwise we are stuck with the awesomeness of 1.3 mega pixel's the Krazer puts out.  Anyone else planning on attending?  Let me know!&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;
