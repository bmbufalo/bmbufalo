<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;So it's been a week.  As I stated before, Samantha's Opa (grandpa in German) has died and we will be attending the funeral this Sunday.  We appreciate everyone's concern.&lt;p /&gt;I have been trying to keep a good mood but it's been tough.  Harlen was such an important part of this family and he will be sorely missed.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;

<br />Hopefully there will be more post's when things settle down.  Until then I'll be posting on Twitter (as long as they keep it up...they may have found a <a href="http://blog.twitter.com/2008/05/too-much-jabber.html#links" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fix</a> finally) throughout the week.
