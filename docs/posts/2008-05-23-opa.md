<pre><code>At 5:39 am this morning we got the phone call we had been dreading for the past two days.  Samantha's grandfather, Harlen, had died.  He was 81 years old.&lt;p /&gt;He had been struggling with cancer and was in the hospital with pneumonia the last week or so.&lt;p /&gt;I'll post a little more later.&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:rgb(204,204,204);font-size:x-small;"&gt;Blogged with the &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock Browser" target="_new" style="color:rgb(153,153,153);font-weight:bold;" rel="noopener"&gt;Flock Browser&lt;/a&gt;
