<pre><code>Twitter is down!  According to the story (link below) I found on Google News the outage has been for at least an hour.&lt;p /&gt;My new addiction is letting me down.  I guess this is what everyone was talking about outages.  And I laughed at those poor fools who were so dependant on some crazy fad.  Now I guess I have no room to talk.&lt;p /&gt;The weirdest part about this whole thing...I want to keep this post less than 140 characters...odd.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original story I found on Google News:&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2008/05/14/twitter-is-down-i-blame-the-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Twitter is Down; I Blame the Democrats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:rgb(204,204,204);font-size:x-small;"&gt;Blogged with the &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock Browser" target="_new" style="color:rgb(153,153,153);font-weight:bold;" rel="noopener"&gt;Flock Browser&lt;/a&gt;
