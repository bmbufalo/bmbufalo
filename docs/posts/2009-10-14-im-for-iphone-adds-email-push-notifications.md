<div class="gmail_quote">IM+ has been my instant messenger of choice for my iPhone. I recently<br /> bought the full version and have been very happy with the app. And<br /> today they have added a much desired feature, email push notifications<br /> for Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail email accounts. The feature is a bit<br /> hidden but you can activate it under the individual account options by setting it to "On".&nbsp; It does work however in my tests it seems to be a bit slower than the actual email arriving via Gmail's own Google Sync.&nbsp; However this keeps my from having to buy a seperate app and is great feature addition to an already wonderful app. Get it here: <span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"></span></span><a href="http://bit.ly/sdrlu" class="tweet-url web" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/sdrlu</a>.
