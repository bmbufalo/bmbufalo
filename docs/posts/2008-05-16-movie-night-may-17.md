<pre><code>The last votes are in.  I am casting an absentee ballot for someone special to me for Chronicle's of Narnia's latest flick which will tie up the vote.  And since I don't want to see Harold and Kumar's flick, we are going to Narnia.  Right now the plan is to hit the 8:30 show.  Unless we get any major objections to the time (please comment below), I will see you all at Narnia!&lt;p /&gt;Thank's for the reminder Joel!&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian M.
