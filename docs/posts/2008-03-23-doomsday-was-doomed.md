<pre><code>So the turn out was not great.  And because of this we are changing our format.  From now on I am going to choose a movie until people who vote actually start coming.  Doomsday was a bust.  Great action, too much unnecessary gore, and absolutely NO story line.  But we had fun.  It wasn't all bad.  Cajun Steamers was again the place to go to drink.  It was also Kase's 27th birthday weekend and we have some fabulous pictures of him to embarrass him to the world.  See the great pictures and I look forward too seeing you all in 2 weeks!&lt;p /&gt;&lt;table&gt;
