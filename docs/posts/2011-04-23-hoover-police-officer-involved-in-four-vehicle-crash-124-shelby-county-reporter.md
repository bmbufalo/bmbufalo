<strong>HOOVER </strong>— A Hoover police officer was involved in a four-vehicle crash while on the way to assist another police officer, according to Hoover Police Capt. Jim Coker.

At 5:24 p.m. April 21, the Hoover Police Department received a shoplifting call from the Loss Prevention and Theft Department at the Riverchase Galleria.

The suspects struggled with loss prevention officers, elevating the offense from a theft to a robbery, Coker said.

The suspects left the premises, and were spotted by a Hoover police officer a short time later driving down Interstate 65. The police officer pulled the suspects over at an Arby’s on Valleydale Road.

Coker said because there were five people in the car, the officer called for assistance.

Another Hoover police officer, responding to the first officer’s call for assistance, was then involved in a four-vehicle accident at 5:34 p.m. on Valleydale Road near the I-65 on-ramp.

One of the cars in the accident was occupied by two juveniles, one of which was transported to UAB Hospital and the other to Children’s Hospital. Both will be kept overnight for evaluation, Coker said.

The police officer involved in the wreck went to Brookwood Hospital, as did the other two drivers. The officer was released from Brookwood earlier today, and Coker said “it is anticipated” the other two drivers at Brookwood will be released tonight.

Coker also said injuries to the two juveniles do not appear to be life-threatening.

The five suspects in the original shoplifting incident were arrested and are being held in the Hoover City Jail, Coker said.

“Tomorrow, detectives will determine who will be charged with what in the original case at the Galleria,” he said.

Because of a Hoover Police Department policy, the Shelby County Traffic Task Force will investigate the four-vehicle accident at the Hoover Police Department’s request, Coker said.
