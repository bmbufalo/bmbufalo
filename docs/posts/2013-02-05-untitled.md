<blockquote><p class="first">The Turanic Raiders were a race of space pirates and mercenaries known from their first attacks in the Turan sector.

<p>This video is based off one of my favourite cutscenes from the PC game &#8216;Homeworld&#8217; and features the original audio, however I decided to re-create the models, textures, etc and bought it up to date with todays visuals.<br />
A comparison video will soon be uploaded onto my YouTube channel.</p></blockquote>
