After much deliberation (rock paper scissors) we have decided to see <a href="http://www.superhero-movie.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Superhero Movie</a> on Saturday, April 5th!  Show time is 9:15 pm at the Patton Creek Rave.  If you want to come an hour early (and are of legal age!) stop by Cajun Steamers for a couple beers before the show!  Check out the trailer and <a href="http://www.superhero-movie.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">visit the website</a> if you don't already know about this one!
