<pre><code>Thank you MacDailyNews!  I've seen this before but as always MDN gives it a good spin.  Check out the article after the break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Microsoft Built Cars... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you'd have to buy a new car.&lt;br /&gt;2. Occasionally your car would just die on the motorway for no reason, and you'd have to restart it. For some strange reason, you'd just accept this, restart and drive on.&lt;br /&gt;3. Your car would inexplicably get slower over time and, every 3-6 months, it would simply grind to halt and fail to restart. At this point, you'd have to reinstall the engine. For some strange reason, you'd just accept this too.&lt;br /&gt;4. Apple would make a car that was powered by the sun, was three times more reliable, fast, and easy to drive--but most people wouldn't know it or believe it.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apple car owners would get expensive Microsoft upgrades to their cars which would make their cars go much slower.&lt;br /&gt;6. Microsoft would replace the oil, engine, gas and alternator warning lights with a single "General Car Fault" warning light.&lt;br /&gt;7. People would get excited about the "new" features in Microsoft cars, not knowing that they had been available in Apple's cars for many years.&lt;br /&gt;8. Microsoft cars would come with 5-year-old Apple car paint jobs, but they'd be the same crappy Microsoft car underneath.&lt;br /&gt;9. If you were involved in a crash, you'd have no idea what happened.&lt;br /&gt;10. Before deploying, the airbag system would ask "Cancel or Allow?"&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://macdailynews.com/index.php/weblog/comments/19317/"&gt;MacDailyNews - What if Steve Jobs ran one of the U.S. auto companies?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.mofuse.mobi/"&gt;bmbufalo mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-2025924758644600969?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
