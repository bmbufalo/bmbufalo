<pre><code>A lot has happened for me lately in my personal and professional life that will begin to be reflected here on my personal web space, &lt;a href="http://www.bmbufalo.com"&gt;Brian's Latest&lt;/a&gt;. My business, &lt;a href="http://www.braincase.biz" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;BrainCase Inc&lt;/a&gt;, that I started with a colleague of mine is in the process of being dissolved. While this sounds really bad it's going to open up some opportunities as well.&amp;nbsp; I plan on continuing to repair computers large and small on my own in my spare time.&amp;nbsp; What that means is I am going to have to&amp;nbsp; grow my website to accommodate both the professional and personal aspect of my life.&amp;nbsp; I am going to have to find a way to maintain a business and a personal space here.&amp;nbsp; Most important is getting a professional presence up in the short term that is presentable and easy to use for my customers and myself.&amp;nbsp; I have registered a new &lt;a href="http://www.bufalocomputerservices.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;domain name&lt;/a&gt;, ordered the business cards and have been brainstorming ways this is going to work out.&amp;nbsp; Thus far it's a work in progress.&amp;nbsp; Fortunately, this is the part of the process that is so exciting and so much fun!&amp;nbsp; In the long term I hope to have a website experience that myself, my customers, and those who follow my personal life can enjoy while staying simple for me to maintain.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt;

I'll keep you posted!
