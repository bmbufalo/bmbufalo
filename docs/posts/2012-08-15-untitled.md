<blockquote>I’m right-handed, but my Mom is left-handed, does that make me a half-lefty? Maybe? It’s that a… <em>stretch</em>?*

<blockquote>
<strong>Left-Handed Presidents<br /></strong>

If you’re a southpaw, you’re in good Presidential company. Many of our U.S. Presidents have been left-handed, including Harry S. Truman, Gerald R. Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama.

Both Presidents Truman and Reagan were switched to writing with their right hands as young school children, but photos show them favoring the left in other activities. It’s widely believed that Herbert Hoover was also left-handed, but archivists at the Hoover Library tell us that they’ve found no documentation - it’s just left hander’s lore.

<strong>Happy International Left Handers Day!</strong>
