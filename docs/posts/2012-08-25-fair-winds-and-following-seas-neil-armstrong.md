I missed witnessing the landing on the Moon but those space travelers legacy remains my inspiration. Today&#8217;s news of Neil Armstrong&#8217;s passing is a day of sadness for myself and the world. What he represents and what we accomplished is bigger than Columbus&#8217; landing in the New World. Let us hope that we can continue his legacy and the legacy of the nation&#8217;s space program, and continue to make the next big step for mankind.
