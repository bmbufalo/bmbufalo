<pre><code>&lt;div style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:medium;"&gt;I just finished watching the WWDC announcement and I have to say this line is the one that got stuck in my head. &amp;nbsp;Where are these 10's of millions going to come from?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

<div><span style="font-size:medium;">The only device presented that is compatible with FaceTime was the iPhone 4. &nbsp;But that only accounts for "<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUS168083514520100608">6 to 8 million units</a>," according to Yankee Group&nbsp;analyst&nbsp;Carl Howe, unless they updated their other&nbsp;devices like the iPod Touch or iPad and released them sometime this year. &nbsp;However a very large product line, one which was not even mentioned&nbsp;during&nbsp;the keynote, and one that is already in place with the hardware available is the Mac desktops and laptop lines that will see the first outgrowth of FaceTime. &nbsp;I am guessing Apple will release an update to iChat and integrate the two together to make this a reality. &nbsp;And with FaceTime as an open standard there is huge&nbsp;possibilities&nbsp;for companies such as Skype to integrate their already large audience to a new platform, which according to some in the company, sounds like something <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-20007298-233.html">they are interested in</a>. &nbsp;All in all I think this is the most exciting announcement to come out of the&nbsp;presentation and cannot wait to get my hands on a new iPhone 4!&nbsp;</span></div>
