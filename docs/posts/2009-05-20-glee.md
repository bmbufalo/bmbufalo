<pre><code>I was very surprised with how good Glee was tonight. It was subtily&lt;br /&gt;funny, very touching, and the classic show down; the under dogs face&lt;br /&gt;off against some pretty high odds. I am really looking forward to&lt;br /&gt;catching this show. Anyone else have a chance to see it? Fox is&lt;br /&gt;advertising if you missed it you can catch it on Fox.com all summer&lt;br /&gt;long and the series will start in the fall.   Sound off in the&lt;br /&gt;comments with what you thought.--
