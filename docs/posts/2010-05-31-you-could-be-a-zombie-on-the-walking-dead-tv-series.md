Are you good at groaning, moaning, and listless shuffling? If you're in the Atlanta metro, you could showcase your range playing an undead roamer in <a href="http://io9.com/5453390/amc-greenlights-frank-darabonts-walking-dead-tv-series">Frank Darabont's <em>The Walking Dead</em> TV series</a>.

According to <a href="http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2010/05/27/amcs-walking-dead-first-filming-locations-revealed-zombies-wanted/">On Location Vacations</a>, <em>The Walking Dead</em> TV series is set in Atlanta (like the first few issues of the comic) and is being filmed in the city's Fairlie-Poplar District. Says OLV:
<blockquote>
The final scenes of the pilot episode and scenes for the second episode would be filmed during daylight hours over the course of two (2) weekends. The first weekend would be scheduled for June 11&ndash;13; the second weekend is scheduled for July 2&ndash;4. [...] In the meantime, the production company is still looking for extras to appear as zombies in the series.

But, all extras must attend ZOMBIE SCHOOL! All of the "zombies' who have been chosen so far have been put through the paces and have already been attending "class" all week, they've also been told they can't discuss anything about the production and may be fired for even the slightest hint about the production on Twitter, FB, etc.

If you think you can handle being a zombie, you can email your information to <a href="http://io9.com/5551297/you-could-be-a-zombie-in-the-walking-dead-tv-series/mailto:twdextras@gmail.com">twdextras@gmail.com</a>, you will need to have a "flexible schedule" from June to September.

Imagine the possibilities - YOU could be the zombie <a href="http://io9.com/5510866/love-actually-star-will-slay-zombies-in-walking-dead">that the guy from <em>Love Actually</em></a> bludgeons with a shovel!
