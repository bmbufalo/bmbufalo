<pre><code>Right now Harold and Kumar are in the lead with three votes for Movie Night.  Keep voting for your choice.&lt;p /&gt;We will be breaking schedule for Indian Jones' latest flick (tentatively) on Thursday around 7:45 PM (according to &lt;a href="http://www.movietickets.com/"&gt;MovieTickets.com&lt;/a&gt;).  More information to come as it gets closer.  Stay tuned.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Brian&lt;div class="blogger-post-footer"&gt;&lt;img class="posterous_download_image" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/2675399127377711436-3344085374645484892?l=bmbufalo.blogspot.com" height="1" alt="" width="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
