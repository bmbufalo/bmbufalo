<pre><code>While not dependent on the iPhone's recent ability to tether, I do like having it as an option when all else fails.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately updating to the latest firmware the hack I use was broken.&amp;nbsp; Not to be dismayed as the developer, Ben, has a fix on the way that will re-enable the now defunct tethering. &lt;p /&gt; For those of you who do not know how this works, many different hacks came out shortly after AT&amp;amp;T announced that tethering would not be out (although third world countries would be able to do this....) and as all good hackers do, they found a way to enable this feature to work anyways.&amp;nbsp; Simply point your iPhone's Safari browser to &lt;a href="http://help.benm.at"&gt;http://help.benm.at&lt;/a&gt; and follow the instructions to enable both tethering and MMS functionality.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt; Ben and his team posted there should be a fix on the way and also to note that AT&amp;amp;T will be enabling MMS September 25th.&amp;nbsp;
