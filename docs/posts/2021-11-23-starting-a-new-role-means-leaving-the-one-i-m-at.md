<p>I have been, first at TekLinks, and then C Spire, for nearly a decade so posting this is something I do not do lightly. But a great opportunity presented itself and I've decided to take a role at Kemper Insurance in their IT department. I'm really excited for this new challenge but I am absolutely crushed leaving everyone I've gotten to know over the years. I have had a chance to get to know so many folks through this role and I will cherish my time at this company. Many of you really had a massive impact on me and I hope to stay in touch. Please feel free to reach out to me if you need anything (even if it's to chat) any time and  I wish everyone the best!</p>
