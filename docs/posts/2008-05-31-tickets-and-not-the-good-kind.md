<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;If you are the one person who follows my going ons through Twitter you may have noticed an early morning post about a ticket.  That's right, I haven't purchased anything for Brewfest yet but instead was handed a citation from the Hoover PD.  I have to say, the officer who stopped me was VERY kind.  I wont go into details but he showed extreme compassion to this poor dolt who was running very late to work this morning.  I am cleaning up my act and am reminded to obey all driving laws.  I have noticed that while living here I have started to drive like THEM. &lt;p /&gt;By THEM, I mean the locals of course.  I wrote something here about how bad the drivers are in Birmingham and now I've noticed that I am picking up some of those bad habits.  That is not good news.  So I am really going to shape up and stop being a dope.&lt;p /&gt;Otherwise nothing new to report.  I can only say that this weekend is going to be low key.  Next post will be about the vacation ramp up!  Tennessee, here we come!&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;
