<pre><code> &lt;span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed an interesting trend since I&amp;rsquo;ve started using Posterous. Every thing I do in Posterous generates so much more traffic than anything else I use. Now, I am by no means a highly read blogger.&amp;nbsp; I&amp;rsquo;m not even consistent, which is evident by the screen shots below.&amp;nbsp; But what is interesting though is my post&amp;rsquo;s generate a whole lot more traffic when using Posterous.&amp;nbsp; What is even more interesting is it seems viewer ship is also up on those sites&amp;rsquo;s I post to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:10pt;font-family:Arial;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:12pt;"&gt;&lt;div class='p_embed p_image_embed'&gt;

<span style="font-size:12pt;">Posterous Traffic</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<span style="font-size:12pt;">Blogger Traffic</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;">There are two reasons for this in my opinion, first, I find Posterous is so simple posting things is fun and therefore I post more often.&nbsp; Second, I post everywhere with the services and because it&rsquo;s all automated and the process by which I post to these services is centralized it is again easier and more fun.</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;">By posting more often I get more hits and drive up the numbers. Posting is quick, either via email, text, or bookmarklet (I generally use the bookmarklet for sharing content and email for generated content such as this post).</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;"></span>

<span style="font-size:12pt;">Anyone else notice this trend with their own experiences? Anyone use a different solution? &nbsp;Comment on it below!</span>
