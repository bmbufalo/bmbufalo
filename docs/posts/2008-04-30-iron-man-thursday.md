<pre><code>The usual place but a different day and time.  The Crew will be at the Patton Creek Rave for Iron Man at 8:00 PM on Thursday, May 1, 2008.  Be sure to get there &lt;span style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;EARLY&lt;/span&gt; and you might consider &lt;a href="http://www.movietickets.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;purchasing your tickets in advance&lt;/a&gt; for this one.  Stop by for all of the fun and excitement!  If you are not already jumping up and down, check out the trailer after the jump and see you all there!&lt;p /&gt;&lt;p /&gt;
