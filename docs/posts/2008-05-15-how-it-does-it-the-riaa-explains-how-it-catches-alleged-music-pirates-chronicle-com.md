<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://chronicle.com/free/2008/05/2821n.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;How It Does It: The RIAA Explains How It Catches Alleged Music Pirates - Chronicle.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;This is very interesting stuff.  Follow the link above for a detailed explanation&lt;br /&gt;of how the RIAA is hunting YOU for pirated material.  The key part of&lt;br /&gt;this topic to me is loud and clear and is yet another reason not to use&lt;br /&gt;the software: Do not use LimeWire! &lt;p /&gt;Something else to consider: while working at a now defunct national computer retailer as a technician, if a computer had LimeWire installed and children were living in the house we formatted the hard drive.  I know that sounds lazy but 9 out of 10 times they were infected. &lt;p /&gt;I wonder how they track you over BitTorrent?
