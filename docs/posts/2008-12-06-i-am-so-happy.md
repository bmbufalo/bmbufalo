<pre><code>The semester is almost over. Next week is finals. Tomorrow is the SEC  &lt;br /&gt;championship. I might pass English as long as I do good on my final  &lt;br /&gt;and the essay I revised today. All my other classes are going well.The business is going slow. I don't have the time I would like to  &lt;br /&gt;dedicate towards it and it turns out were in a recession. So there  &lt;br /&gt;haven't been to many calls. Stupid recession.
</code></pre>

So I am going to try to write here more with dealing ground breaking  <br />material that entertains and informs you, my readership. I need to  <br />make sure I try to keep good on my commitment to myself that I would  <br />maintain this site. Stay tuned.
