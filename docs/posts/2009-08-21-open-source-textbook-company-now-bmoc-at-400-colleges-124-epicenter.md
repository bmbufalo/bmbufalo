What did you do this summer? <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/">Flat World Knowledge</a> stayed busy on campus and now has 40 times as many students and more than 10 times the colleges using their freemium, open-source digital textbooks as they did spring semester. And they did it the old-fashioned way &mdash; one professor at a time.

After a sort of beta earlier this year, Flat World is set to announce Thursday that&nbsp;more than 40,000 college students at 400 colleges will use their digital, DRM-free textbooks fall semester, up from 1,000 in&nbsp;30 colleges in the spring.

Digital textbooks remain a nascent business and a tough market to enter. At an average cost of $100, textbooks command the highest cover prices in publishing, outside of only some art and coffee-table books. Demand is artificially inelastic as students are indentured to cost servitude at the whim of college professors who blithely assign titles a student must own if she hopes to do well in a given course. Now, multiply that by four, five or even six courses a semester and you are talking big bucks.

By comparison, Flat World has a pricing scheme that starts at zero for online access using a browser, and $20 for a PDF, which they believe will be the most popular format. Printed versions of their textbooks cost up to $60.

Perhaps best of all: Textbooks are available a la carte, chapter by chapter.

But the key buy-in has been from teachers who make the assignments and who, in my college days, could not care less how much the textbooks cost. What&rsquo;s changed?

&ldquo;There has been a mind shift,&rdquo; co-founder Eric Frank told Wired.com. &nbsp;A tipping point came a couple of years ago when faculty began to consider the financial burden on students because many of them (Frank estimates a third) didn&rsquo;t bother to get the texbook at all.

Perhaps more to the point, open-source textbooks &mdash; which are Creative Commons-licensed to allow unencumbered non-commercial use &mdash; make it possible to graft supporting material to the curriculum, rather than the other way around.

&ldquo;Faculty are notorious for wanting to do things their way,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;But they always had to cut the foot to fit the shoe. Now, with open source, they can cut the shoe to fit the foot.&rdquo;

There is virtually no friction involved. A professor can register on Flat World&rsquo;s site and let students know that the book is available there. No cooperation from a school district or college administration is required.

&ldquo;Every single class is a fiefdom, and they are kings and queens of their domain,&rdquo; Frank jokes.

Like any freemium retailer, Flat World depends on enough people buying something, because clearly the business cannot be sustained if everyone just opts for free web access. &ldquo;What we&rsquo;re counting on is that people will be willing to pay for different packaging.&rdquo; (Frank proudly notes his company is on <a href="http://www.flatworldknowledge.com/sites/all/files/FWK%20in%20Chris%20Anderson%27s%20FREE%207-20-09.pdf">page 160</a> (.pdf) of <em>Wired</em> magazine editor in chief <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/16-03/ff_free">Chris Anderson&rsquo;s <cite>Free</cite></a>.)

And it will come down to the price points, Frank acknowledges, even when the company develops formats for the Sony e-book reader and Amazon Kindle, as they hope to this year. It makes as much sense to equip students with a device that makes all their reference materials available on demand as to offer a casual reader a complete portable library &nbsp;&mdash; perhaps more. This is a <a href="http://www.eschoolnews.com/news/top-news/?i=59868">classic chicken-and-egg scenario</a> in which a device-dependent culture needs to evolve alongside new content formats.

For this and a variety of other reasons, including the cost of e-readers and for the media they serve up, Frank thinks the PDF will remain the format of choice for students for some time to come (and the ubiquitous and DRM-free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">Portable Document Format</a> is readable on the Sony and Amazon devices, anyway).

&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll move forward,&rdquo; Frank says of device-specific e-reader formats. &ldquo;But there is so much irrational pricing right now that they&rsquo;ll move forward much more slowly than they probably should.&rdquo;

For now, expect a PDF revolution. And what better back-to-school present can you think of for 40,000 hard-up college students in the midst of a recession?
