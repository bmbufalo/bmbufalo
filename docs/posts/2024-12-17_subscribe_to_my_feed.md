# Subscribe to my feed

If you are interested in subscribing to my feed, the easiest method is to copy my [blog's URL address](https://blog.bufalo.me) and paste it into your favorite RSS feed application. Mine is the wonderful [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) which has apps for Mac, iPad, and iPhone and are all fantastic! But there are many options out there and I encourage you to find one you like, but NetNewsWire has the wonderful status of being open source and well crafted to only do one thing, read RSS feeds. Many of the other feed readers you will find require an account and want to do more than you need. [The developer is really committed to this idea!](https://netnewswire.com/philosophy.html)

So copy my site’s URL, add a feed in NetNewsWire using the **+** icon, and press **Add**. Optionally (and recommended) choose the _iCloud_ folders so that your feeds sync to all your devices and show up automatically. That should be all that is required.

If you use something else to manage your RSS feeds, then I assume you can figure out how to subscribe there. But if you are interested in giving NetNewsWire a try, you can export and import your subscriptions as an OPML file that will magically migrate them there.
