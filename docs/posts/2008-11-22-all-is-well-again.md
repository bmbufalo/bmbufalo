<pre><code>So far my computer is up and running again. Most likely culprit was  &lt;br /&gt;Zone Alarm. I think I will still use it, just not on my main desktop.  &lt;br /&gt;Also I learned how truly valuable my iPhone has already become. In  &lt;br /&gt;fact it may become my main blogging tool as I can email in a post  &lt;br /&gt;anywhere and on my own time.In current events the iPhone 2.2 update has been released on the world  &lt;br /&gt;and I must say it is fantastic!  The improvements to Safari, Maps,  &lt;br /&gt;over the air podcasts, and overall speed and reliability are wonderful.

Safari includes a search box at the top next to the address bar,  <br />making searches quicker and easier to access. Maps now includes  <br />Googles Street View which put me in front of my old apartment in San  <br />Diego in seconds. Podcasts can now be grabbed over both 3G and wi-fi  <br />making the iPhone the ultimate multi media device on the market.  <br />Everything seems snappier after the update as well. Flipping through  <br />the home screens felt faster and more responsive.

All in all an improvement in the OS. We are still holding our  <br />collective breath for copy and paste as well as a couple other  <br />features added. All in due time it would seem.
