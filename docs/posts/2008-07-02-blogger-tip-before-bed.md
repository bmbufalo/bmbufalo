<pre><code>As I wait for the latest patch for Call of Duty 4 I have a quick Blogger tip that is so obvious it hurts.&amp;nbsp; I was cruising the interwebs wondering "How are these Bloggers adding navigation links and individual pages to their blogs" and began investigating.&amp;nbsp; Checking out &lt;a href="http://www.rob-sheridan.com/sketchblog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;SketchBlog&lt;/a&gt;, one of the best designed Blogger blogs I've seen, I noticed that each of his "About Me" and "Wallpaper" sub-pages were actually just posts on his site!&amp;nbsp; You pro-bloggers are grinding your teeth and screaming "Noob" (to which you would be correct).&amp;nbsp; But I thought it was relivant to share and so simple I thought it might go unnoticed.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt;The process of actually making it happened is simple as well.&amp;nbsp; Create a couple of blog entries&amp;nbsp; with or without content (you can add it later and can set the post to an earlier date so it doesn't show up as a recent entry), add a HTML/Text widget to your blog from the layout section and get creative.&amp;nbsp; I have added a very simple (and incomplete) one to my page.&amp;nbsp; The HTML is bellow.&amp;nbsp; I'll finish it up later.&amp;nbsp; It looks like COD4 is finished downloading.&amp;nbsp; Enjoy!&lt;p /&gt;&amp;lt;center&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&amp;gt; | &amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com/2008/04/hoover-movie-crew.html" style="font-weight:bold;"&gt;Hoover Movie Crew&lt;/a&gt;&amp;lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&amp;gt; | About Me&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;lt;/center&amp;gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:#CCC;font-size:x-small;"&gt;Blogged with the &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock Browser" target="_new" style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;" rel="noopener"&gt;Flock Browser&lt;/a&gt;
