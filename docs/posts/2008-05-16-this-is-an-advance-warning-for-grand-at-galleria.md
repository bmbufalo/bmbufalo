<pre><code>Engel Residential:&lt;p /&gt;I have had horrible service from your company from day one.&amp;nbsp; This is the beginning of what I hope to be a very lengthy discussion on why no one should ever rent a property at the &lt;a href="http://www.thegrandatgalleria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Grand at Galleria&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I can only speak for what I myself have experienced but I'm sure there are other horror stories.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt;I will scan it in for all to see when I have a chance but our original lease packet included a sheet to fill out with any damage incurred prior to moving in.&amp;nbsp; We did the walk around and noted all the existing problems.&amp;nbsp; I had to use another sheet.&amp;nbsp; That right there should have told me not to move in but we were in a bit of a bind (and still are) for housing so we didn't contest that.&amp;nbsp; Now, after two years of living at this apartment, we still have 90% of the issues on the list that have never been addressed even after we were assured that they would be within the first few months of us living there.&lt;p /&gt;What prompted me to publish this aspect of my life is that Monday I placed a maintenance request with the front office and assured a "twenty-four to forty-eight hour response" time to my claim.&amp;nbsp; So on Wednesday I came home to discover that my toilet still leaks all over the bathroom floor.&amp;nbsp; The hose that refills the tank has come loose and is waving about after each flush.&amp;nbsp; It really is not major.&amp;nbsp; But I have stopped cleaning it up.&amp;nbsp; The mold that accumulates in the bathroom and eventually condemns my building will be my final word.&amp;nbsp; I don't care any more.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt;Like I said, this is just the beginning.&amp;nbsp; Do not rent an apartment at Grand at Galleria.&amp;nbsp; You will regret it.&amp;nbsp; Is there anyone else who has a sob story?&amp;nbsp; Post in the comments.&amp;nbsp; Your shoulder is waiting.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://engelresidential.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;http://engelresidential.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thegrandatgalleria.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;http://www.thegrandatgalleria.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:#CCC;font-size:x-small;"&gt;Blogged with the &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock Browser" target="_new" style="color:#999;font-weight:bold;" rel="noopener"&gt;Flock Browser&lt;/a&gt;
