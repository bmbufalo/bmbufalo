<pre><code>Due to a death in the family the usual suspects will not be previewing Indiana Jones this weekend.  We appreciate everyone's love and support and hope to make it out for the next showing. &lt;p /&gt;Hopefully I will post with next weeks movie's up here as soon as I find the time.  Check my personal blog for more information on what is going on, as long as I can post.  My DSL is off at home and so far Bellsouth hasn't turned that on, either.  It's been a week.&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;p /&gt;Brian&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;div class="flockcredit" style="text-align:right;color:rgb(204,204,204);font-size:x-small;"&gt;Blogged with the &lt;a href="http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock" title="Flock Browser" target="_new" style="color:rgb(153,153,153);font-weight:bold;" rel="noopener"&gt;Flock Browser&lt;/a&gt;
