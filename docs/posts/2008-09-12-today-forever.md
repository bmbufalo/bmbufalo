<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This day has a lot of meaning.&amp;nbsp; The repercussions of this day have brought us to where we are today.&amp;nbsp; There is so much different and changing in our modern era.&amp;nbsp; But there is so much that is the same.&amp;nbsp; People everywhere want to raise families, love each other, and make a difference in their world.&amp;nbsp; No matter how much conflict here at home and around the world we are all the same.&amp;nbsp; We are all people.&amp;nbsp; &lt;p /&gt;Never forget, always forgive, find peace with yourself and your world and have a great time along the way.&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neatorama.com/2008/09/11/remembering-the-victims-of-911/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;http://www.neatorama.com/2008/09/11/remembering-the-victims-of-911/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p /&gt;--&lt;br /&gt;Brian&lt;p /&gt;&lt;a href="http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com"&gt;http://bmbufalo.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
